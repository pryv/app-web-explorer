### Publish to github pages

If it is the first time you publish app-web-explorer, be sure to run `yarn serve` once.

Create a distribution with your changes by running `yarn build`.

Then, publish your changes by running `yarn run publish`

If you encounter conflicts while publishing, run `yarn clear` to reset the `dist/` folder,
then build and publish again.
